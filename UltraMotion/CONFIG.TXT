# Configurable IO pins

# DIO1 and DIO2 are configurable I/O pins.
# They can act as high-speed digital inputs, 
# or 5V digital outputs which can source up to 250mA, or sink up to 2 amps.
# There are three variables to configure each DIO pin: ioPinx, ioBitx, and ioPWMx where "x" is either "1" or "2"

# ioPinx Mode Selectors
# 0 = Input (high impedance)
# 1 = Output GND
# 2 = Output +5V
# 3 = Output status bit (masked status bits, 1KHz update)
# 4 = Output 1KHz PWM

# ioBitx is a mask used when ioPinx = 3.
# ioBitx is bitwise ANDed with the status register, the result is tested for 0

# ioPWMx PWM Output Source Selectors (ioPinx = 4)
# All source ranges are converted to the PWM duty-cycle
# range of 0-60000
# 0 = Actuator position (spMin to spMax)
# 1 = Actuator velocity (-512 to +511)
# 2 = Actuator torque (-32768 to +32767)
# 3 = Bus Voltage (0 to 1023)
# 4 = Commanded position (spMin to spMax)
# 5 = 1-2ms pulse input channel (pMin to pMax)
# 6 = Analog voltage input (vMin to vMax)
# 7 = Analog current input (cMin to cMax)
