Hello, 
I have the cylinder in voltage mode, and am aware of the voltage filter option, however, other than smoothing the input signal, is there another way to smooth the movements of the cylinder in general, and make its movements less shaky?

Rob
Hi hannah

Have you looked at your voltage signal to see if it is very noisy?
Hannah
I am using a sine wave generator which should be supplying a smooth signal


Rob
Is it shaky when stationary?
Hannah
No

A small vibration is being created, much less than a millimeter in amplitude when the cylinder is moving

However, I would like to decrease the vibration effect


Rob
You should first scope your signal to make sure its a clean signal
Hannah
I have done this

Is there a way to check to see if it has to do with feedback to the cylinder or another variable in the movement?


Rob
do you have a serial connection to the actuator?
Hannah
yes


Rob
you can stream your "command"

Are you grounding the shielding on the signal line?
Hannah
How would I stream a 0.5Hz 10cm sine wave?

We use analog commands because that is what we are familiar with, however, would like to use serial if you have any suggestions on how to do so.


Rob
I suggested the streaming to help diagnose if the signal is noisy
Hannah
We are very sure that our signal is clean. If it wasn't, it would vibrate if stationary and we are very familiar with analog sine waves.


Rob
I am not doubting the signal is clean coming out of the generator.  I am wondering if it's picking up noise from the motor power wires as it travels to the actuator

If this was the case, it would not vibrate unless it was moving
Hannah
so how would this be minimized?


Rob
are you connecting the shield "drain wires" to ground for the analog and power cables?

If the servo is getting a clean signal it will be very stable and not vibrate

with a serial connection, you can stream the command input and see if can see the bouncing input

Can you send a video of the vibration?
Hannah
okay, how would I do this in serial?

Bill left the chat

Rob
do you have a serial port on a computer nearby?
Hannah
Yes

We are connected at the moment

The vibration would be hardly visible in a video.  It is very tiny but important for our experiment

The serial port is connected at the moment


Rob
do you have putty or some other serial terminal for windows
Hannah
yes


Rob
check what port you have the servo conencted to
Hannah
I am already connected with the servo and can communicate with it through putty


Rob
great

send an x11 command
Hannah
okay


Rob
what was the response

I am not in front of a servo so I am working from memory
Hannah
It just said Stream Column1: 1 Actuator Position Type: 16 but unsigned integer


Rob
ok

it should be X12

Hannah
okay


Rob
we are setting up to stream the setpoint
Hannah
okay, what is the next step


Rob
x216

you can steam up to 3 columns of data
Hannah
okay


Rob
x216 streams the analog input

XS will turn streaming on
Hannah
okay, it said OK


Rob
do you have analog filter set?

i am sorry...XG enables streaming

XS turns it off
Hannah
I figured it out and it streamed

What should we do with these numbers? Plot them?


Rob
they should not be bouncing now
Hannah
yes


Rob
start sending your voltage command

you can grab these values and see if they are bouncing

just out of curiosity, did you try the analog filter and did it help?
Hannah
yes, we tried even applying a filter of 500 and it was not smooth. There was no visible difference from 6000


Rob
Can you email me the config file.  rob@ultramotion.com
Hannah
okay, I just sent it


Rob
ok....I dont see any major config problems

How are you detecting the vibration?
Hannah
The cylinder is operating a moving arm that is partially in water and we can see the movement in rippling on the waters surface in the direction perpendicular to the movement of the arm


Rob
are you pushing much load?
Hannah
no, it is less than 200grams on a slide

We can also feel the vibrations


Rob
try changing PID gains
Hannah
How should I adjust those numbers?


Rob
before we do that, can you send details for the signal generator

and can you type "fs" and let me know the firmware version
Hannah
the version is 0.954. What information on the signal generator would you like>


Rob
part number
Hannah
Agilent 33210A and we have the appropriate 50ohm termination on it.  We have also used an HP8904 sine wave generator with no difference between the function of the device on the two generators


Rob
OK..lets try changing the config PID

kp = 1000
ki = 200000
kd = 10000
Hannah
That seems to be smoother


Rob
you need to restart the servo for the new gains to take effect
Hannah
Yes, we did the zr 321.  It worked great! Thank you! Do you have any hints on adjusting the PID values?


Rob
It's triky to tune the PID without watching the feedback

It comes tuned to "default" settings for "snappy" response.
Hannah
Any hints would be great, but its about time to head out of the lab.  We can play with these numbers another day to further adjust.

Thank you!


Rob
You can also adjust the FOC gains in the hardware.txt

this will help as well
Hannah
How would you suggest altering this?


Rob
Qp

Qi, Dp, and Di
default values should be 4500 and 450

you can try 2500 and 250
	
Qp and Dp are typically 4500  Qi and Di and 450







New conversation: June 13, 2016



Hannah
Hello, I am trying to adjust the numbers for the qi, dp, and di values for a servo cylinder to make the motions smoother.  I've noticed that there is an inverse relationship between the smoothness of the motion and the values for these numbers.  But I am just wondering how adjusting only one of the values will affect the motion.

Hi Hannah, our engineering department is busy at the moment. Can I have someone get back to you shortly?
Hannah
Yes. Thank you so much!


Bill
no problem. someone will get back to you within the next hour or so
Hannah
okay thank you

Tom
Hi Hannah
Hannah
hello

Bill left the chat

Tom
these values represent the proportional and integral gains responsible for controlling the current through the motor coils
Hannah
Okay, so would you have any suggestions on adjusting them to increase the smoothness of the machines


Tom
the best way to adjust these is to stream motor current feedback and motor current setpoint and adjust the FOC gains until the error is as small as possible

using the default gain values should result in smooth motion. Any disturbances due to slight PID instability will be high frequency (5-10 kHz)
Hannah
The default gain values did not create a smooth enough motion.  There are no issues with our signal going into the cylinder, so we are trying to use these numbers to decrease vibrations that are resulting from the movement of the cylinder


Tom
and you've adjusted the position PID gains in the coniguration file?
Hannah
The last person that I talked to said to adjust them in the hardware file


Tom
there are position PID gains in the configuration file. The FOC (Field-Oriented Control) gains are locating the hardware file
Hannah
Okay. How should I change these values for increased smoothness


Tom
The position PID gains can be reduced to smooth motion
Hannah
For reference, we are working in voltage mode

okay, do you have any suggestions on what values to try


Tom
I would try position PID gain values around Kp = 500,, Ki = 20000, Kd = 4000

these are low values that should smooth out your motion

what are your current values for both position and FOC gains/
Hannah
the current values for kp, ki and kd were the default and the foc gains are qi=250 dp=2500 and di=250


Tom
qd is set to 2500 as well?
Hannah
do you mean qp?


Tom
yes, sorry
Hannah
its okay! I was not instructed to alter this number.  Should I change that as well?


Tom
yes, set that to 2500 instead of 4500
Hannah
okay thank you


Tom
then try the position PID gains that I sent above as well
Hannah
I believe that had an effect.  If I continue to lower those numbers will it increase the smoothness? Also, is there any drawback to lowering these numbers?


Tom
further reducing these values will lead to a very "loose" system that does not respond well to external disturbances

it is also possible that the system becomes unstable when continuing to lower the gains
Hannah
Okay, thank you


Tom
unfortunately, this isn't a calculable number and has to be determined experimentally.
Hannah
What would you say is the threshold for instability?


Tom
very hard to say since it is highly dependent on motion profiles, system inertia, loads, etc.

I would mostly try lowering Kd
Hannah
okay thank you


Tom
no problem, let me know how it goes

my direct email is tom@ultramotion.com
Hannah
thank you
